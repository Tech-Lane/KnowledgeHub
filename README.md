# KnowledgeHubV2

KnowledgeHubV2 is a flexible, offline-first knowledge management application built with Blazor WebAssembly. It allows users to create, organize, and link notes, embed structured data tables, and perform dynamic calculations, all while keeping their data stored securely on their local machine.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Local-First Data**: All data is stored in a user-managed `.db` file on the local file system. You have full control over your data.
*   **Hierarchical Organization**: Organize your notes and documents in a familiar folder structure.
*   **Rich-Text Note Editor**: A full-featured editor for formatting notes, including headers, lists, and links.
*   **Embeddable Data Tables**: Create structured tables directly within your notes to track data.
*   **Dynamic Data References**: Pull aggregate data from your tables (like sums and averages) and display it directly in your notes with dynamic references (e.g., `{{TableName.ColumnName.sum}}`).
*   **Drag-and-Drop**: Easily reorganize your notes and folders.
*   **Backup/Restore**: Export and import your entire knowledge base to a JSON-based format (`.khb`), with optional password protection.
